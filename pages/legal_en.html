<p>Unless a more specific storage period has been specified in this privacy policy, your personal data will remain

<h5 id="general-information-on-the-legal-basis-for-the-data-processing-on-this-website">General information on the legal basis for the data processing on this website</h5>

<p>If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data on the basis of Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR or
Art. 9 (2)(a) GDPR, if special categories of data are processed according to Art. 9 (1) DSGVO. In the case of
explicit consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries, the data processing is also based on Art.
49 (1)(a) GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or to the access to information in your end
device (e.g., via device fingerprinting), the data processing is additionally based on § 25 (1) TDDDG. The

6(1)(c) GDPR. Furthermore, the data processing may be carried out on the basis of our legitimate interest

<p>In the scope of our business activities, we cooperate with various external parties. In some cases, this also
requires the transfer of personal data to these external parties. We only disclose personal data to external
parties if this is required as part of the fulfillment of a contract, if we are legally obligated to do so (e.g.,
disclosure of data to tax authorities), if we have a legitimate interest in the disclosure pursuant to Art. 6 (1)(f)
GDPR, or if another legal basis permits the disclosure of this data. When using processors, we only disclose
personal data of our customers on the basis of a valid contract on data processing. In the case of joint
processing, a joint processing agreement is concluded.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="revocation-of-your-consent-to-the-processing-of-data">Revocation of your consent to the processing of data</h5>

of any data collection that occurred prior to your revocation.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="right-to-object-to-the-collection-of-data-in-special-cases-right-to-object-to-direct-advertising-art-21-gdpr">Right to object to the collection of data in special cases; right to object to direct advertising (Art. 21 GDPR)</h5>

<p>IN THE EVENT THAT DATA ARE PROCESSED ON THE BASIS OF ART. 6(1)(E) OR (F) GDPR, YOU HAVE
THE RIGHT TO AT ANY TIME OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA BASED ON
GROUNDS ARISING FROM YOUR UNIQUE SITUATION. THIS ALSO APPLIES TO ANY PROFILING BASED
ON THESE PROVISIONS. TO DETERMINE THE LEGAL BASIS, ON WHICH ANY PROCESSING OF DATA IS
BASED, PLEASE CONSULT THIS DATA PROTECTION DECLARATION. IF YOU LOG AN OBJECTION, WE
WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA, UNLESS WE ARE IN A POSITION TO
PRESENT COMPELLING PROTECTION WORTHY GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING OF YOUR DATA,
THAT OUTWEIGH YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OR IF THE PURPOSE OF THE
PROCESSING IS THE CLAIMING, EXERCISING OR DEFENCE OF LEGAL ENTITLEMENTS (OBJECTION
PURSUANT TO ART. 21(1) GDPR).</p>

<p>IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS BEING PROCESSED IN ORDER TO ENGAGE IN DIRECT ADVERTISING,
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA FOR
THE PURPOSES OF SUCH ADVERTISING AT ANY TIME. THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING TO THE
EXTENT THAT IT IS AFFILIATED WITH SUCH DIRECT ADVERTISING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL
DATA WILL SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER BE USED FOR DIRECT ADVERTISING PURPOSES

at any time. You may also have a right to have your data rectified or eradicated. If you have questions about
this subject matter or any other questions about personal data, please do not hesitate to contact us at any
time.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="right-to-demand-processing-restrictions">Right to demand processing restrictions</h5>

<p>You have the right to demand the imposition of restrictions as far as the processing of your personal data is
concerned. To do so, you may contact us at any time. The right to demand restriction of processing applies in
the following cases:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In the event that you should dispute the correctness of your data archived by us, we will usually need
some time to verify this claim. During the time that this investigation is ongoing, you have the right to
demand that we restrict the processing of your personal data.</li>
  <li>If the processing of your personal data was/is conducted in an unlawful manner, you have the option to
demand the restriction of the processing of your data instead of demanding the eradication of this data.</li>
  <li>If we do not need your personal data any longer and you need it to exercise, defend or claim legal
entitlements, you have the right to demand the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead
of its eradication.</li>
  <li>If you have raised an objection pursuant to Art. 21(1) GDPR, your rights and our rights will have to be
weighed against each other. As long as it has not been determined whose interests prevail, you have the
right to demand a restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, these data – with the exception of their archiving –
may be processed only subject to your consent or to claim, exercise or defend legal entitlements or to
protect the rights of other natural persons or legal entities or for important public interest reasons cited by
the European Union or a member state of the EU.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="ssl-andor-tls-encryption">SSL and/or TLS encryption</h5>

<p>For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as purchase orders or
inquiries you submit to us as the website operator, this website uses either an SSL or a TLS encryption
program. You can recognize an encrypted connection by checking whether the address line of the browser
switches from “http://” to “https://” and also by the appearance of the lock icon in the browser line.</p>

<p>If the SSL or TLS encryption is activated, data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="rejection-of-unsolicited-e-mails">Rejection of unsolicited e-mails</h5>

<p>We herewith object to the use of contact information published in conjunction with the mandatory
information to be provided in our Site Notice to send us promotional and information material that we have
not expressly requested. The operators of this website and its pages reserve the express right to take legal
action in the event of the unsolicited sending of promotional information, for instance via SPAM messages.</p>
